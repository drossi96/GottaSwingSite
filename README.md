#GottaSwingSite 

##Description##

My GottaSwing Site is a built-from-scratch mock-up website created for the purpose of showcasing my web development skills. It demonstrates my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by replicating and the refining the website of gottaswing.com. My site also
demonstrates my ability to use the bootstrap framework libraries to make responsive and dynamic HTML, CSS, and JS elements. GottaSwing.com is a website designed for a swing dancing event and teaching company in the Washington DC, Maryland , and Virginia area, specializing 
in jitterbug lindy hop, and other jazz dancing. My site, built from scratch, aims to provide a vibrant and engaging experience for users interested in dance and classes and events. My site showcases a vibrant , engaging aesthetic that captures the energetic and retro 
spirit of swing dancing, enticing prospective students and attendees. My site includes an aesthetic composed of a vintage pastel color pallette and font typeface collection inspired by the cinematic works of directors like Wes Anderson, which I feel lends itself 
to the retro and revivalist theme of the gottaswing company and the aesthetics of swing dancing and jazz music. My objective was to demonstrate my front-end development skills, including dynamic responsive components and on-brand design.   

##Features##

• Hero Section: A video playing on load showcasing high-energy swing dancing cinemetography and promotional content.
• Interactive Elements: Included interactive elements such as a navigation with drop-down menus created using CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.
• Animations and Transitions: Used CSS animations and transitions to enhance the user experience and make the website more engaging.
• Responsive Design: Ensured the website maintains its aesthetic appeal and functionality across various devices and screen sizes.
• On-brand Aesthetics: vibrant, retro-and-cinematic-inspired aesthetic with a vintage pastel color palette and typography, capturing the spirit of swing dancing.

##Challenges##

•Responsive Design: Maintaining a cohesive and engaging user experience across various devices was crucial, as responsive design needed to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.
•Interactive Elements: Implementing interactive elements posed challenges in ensuring smooth functionality without compromising performance.


##Solutions##

•Responsive Design: To address responsive design, I utilized CSS Grid and Flexbox, along with media queries, to create an adaptable layout for all devices.
•Interactive Elements: Interactive features such as the navigation with dropdown menus, CSS animations, and auto-playing video were developed to enhance user engagement.


##Outcome##
This project significantly enhanced my technical abilities while reinforcing my understanding of web design principles and best practices. The GottaSwing mock website effectively 
demonstrates my capability to create an engaging and functional website that captures the energetic spirit of swing dancing. It stands as a testament to my skills in responsive design and interactivity, preparing me for real-world web development challenges.
